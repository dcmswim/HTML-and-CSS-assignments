 Tech Academy HTML and CSS assignments
 
 This is a sample of several small projects done while learning basic HTML and CSS. 
 
 ### Website Project:
 This is a simple one page site that was created to utilize different HTML and CSS components. It's a mock website for a cat adoption agency. Includes photos, animations, and a submission/contact form. 
 
 ### OnePageWebsite: 
 This is mainly more practice with form submission.
 
 ### Bootstrap4:
 This was an exercise in utilizing code from Bootstrap to create a basic webpage.
 
 There are also various html files that were created while watching instructional videos from The Tech Academy. These were saved for reference materials during my earlier studies.
